## Features

- **Interest-based Chatting:** Users can register and choose a set of interests they would like to discuss with others. The app matches users with similar interests, enabling meaningful conversations and connections.

- **Cyberbullying Detection:** To ensure a safe environment, Chatty utilizes a machine learning model to monitor messages. If a message is identified as cyberbullying, it is prevented from reaching the intended recipient. The sender is prompted with a warning, discouraging such behavior.

- **User Behavior Tracking:** The app keeps track of user behavior and identifies patterns of cyberbullying. If a user consistently exhibits bullying behavior, they are temporarily banned from using the app. If the behavior persists, the user is permanently logged out and banned from accessing the app again.

- **Profile Preview:** Users have the ability to view the profiles of others they wish to engage in conversations with. This feature allows users to gather information about potential chat partners before initiating a conversation.

- **Customizable Profiles:** Users can create and customize their own profiles, providing information about themselves. They can edit their profile details to reflect their interests, hobbies, and any other relevant information.
